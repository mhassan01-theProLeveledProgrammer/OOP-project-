 # SPOT-FLIX

This C++ program simulates a text-based user interface for a streaming service called "SPOT-FLIX." It begins with an animated logo display and then presents the user with a menu of options to choose from, including listening to songs, reading novels, watching movies, or watching TV series.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:

1. **Header Includes**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <windows.h>
   #include <cstdlib>
   #include <fstream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
   - These lines include the necessary C++ standard libraries for input/output operations, Windows console functions, random number generation, and file handling.

2. **Class Declarations**:
   - The program defines three classes: `Logo`, `logo2`, and `Interest`.

3. **`Logo` Class**:
   - This class contains a function called `log()` that displays an animated SPOT-FLIX logo using `system()` calls to change console colors and `Sleep()` to control the display timing.

4. **`logo2` Class**:
   - This class contains a function called `asking()` that displays a menu of options for the user to select from.

5. **`Interest` Class**:
   - This class contains functions to get the user's interest (choice of activity) and select the corresponding option.

6. **`Novels` Class**:
   - This class contains a function called `novels()` that handles the user's selection of reading novels.

7. **`EngUrdNovels` Class**:
   - This class inherits from the `Novels` class and contains a function called `englishnovels()` that handles the user's selection of English novels and displays a list of genres to choose from.

8. **`main()` Function**:
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
   - It creates instances of the `Logo`, `logo2`, `Interest`, and `EngUrdNovels` classes.
   - It calls the `log()` function to display the animated logo.
   - It calls the `asking()` function to display the menu of options.
   - It calls the `getit()` and `selection()` functions to get the user's interest and select the corresponding option.
   - Depending on the
